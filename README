These are my solutions to various online coding problem sets and exercises. 
I started with zero programming experience when I began working through Harvard's CS50 online course material.
I believe these solutions show significant progress as I continue to learn.
I am not and have never been, an enrolled student at these universities.
This is merely the code of someone teaching themselves in their spare time.
Please report any bugs you find, as this code is far from perfect.
Thanks for visisting.
